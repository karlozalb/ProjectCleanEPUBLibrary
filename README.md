# ProjectCleanEPUBLibrary
A lightweight, simple and fast EPUB 3.0.1 parser library.

Hey! This is just a parser, and currently the development is stopped. Why? because I only use this to parse the book metadata, get the cover, etc. For the EPUB rendering I'm currently using https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js/
